# Rat Chat App

WebSocket Chat Project for Web Security
Created by Kevin Nguyen

## NOTE: README IS WIP, APP IS TRANSITIONING TO A WEBAPP INSTEAD OF A .HTML FILE. EVERYTHING BELOW IS OBSOLETE AT THE MOMENT. OLD FILES LOCATED IN /SRC/DOCS

## Usage

### Starting the Websocket Server

Download the server.py and run using python3 or later.
`python3 server.py`

### Running the Websocket Client

Ensure the IP in `client.html` matches the target websocket IP. Then, open `client.html` in your browser of choice after the websocket server is running.

## server.py

This file contains the python script to start the websocket server. It is hosted on my Pi4B in my case and is completely independent from both of the clients aside from being on the same local network.

## client.html

Web client pre-loaded in HTML
